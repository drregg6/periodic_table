Javascript Periodic Table

Practicing data manipulation by creating an interactive periodic table
Idea from <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b" target="_blank">From Zero to Front End Hero</a>

Strong focus is on using minimal HTML - I want to play around with vanilla javascript
Practicing with Flexbox for element placement and sizing

Not exactly responsive, but should look decent on mobile and desktop alike
